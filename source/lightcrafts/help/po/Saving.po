"![image](images/JPEG-LZN.jpg) When you save your work, LightZone saves your "
"photo as a \"LightZone JPEG\" file. A \"LightZone JPEG\" file is an ordinary "
"JPEG file that is a preview version of your original photo but also contains "
"the [tool stack](Tool_Stack.html) you created while editing your photo. By "
"default, LightZone appends `_lzn` to the file name to indicate that it's a "
"LightZone JPEG."

"Being an ordinary JPEG file, it can be opened by any application that works "
"with JPEG files, be e-mailed, or displayed on the web. When reopened with "
"LightZone, however, the tool stack is restored and you can resume editing "
"where you left off. [Thumbnails](Thumbnails.html) in the [Photo "
"Browser](Anatomy-Browser.html) indicate LightZone JPEG files with "
"\"JPEG-LZN\" as shown above."

"A LightZone JPEG still refers to your original photo (whether it's a raw, "
"TIFF, or another JPEG). Therefore, you should never delete your original "
"photo."
