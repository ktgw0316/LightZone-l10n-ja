"Absolute Colorimetric\n"
"  ~ Leaves colors that fall inside the destination gamut unchanged.\n"
"    Out-of-gamut colors are clipped. No scaling of colors to the\n"
"    destination white point is performed. This intent tries to maintain\n"
"    color accuracy at the expense of preserving relationships between\n"
"    colors and is suitable for proofing to simulate the output of a\n"
"    particular device. This intent is particularly useful for previewing\n"
"    how paper color affects printed colors.\n"
"Relative Colorimetric\n"
"  ~ Compares the extreme highlight of the source color space to that of\n"
"    the destination color space and shifts all colors accordingly.\n"
"    Out-of-gamut colors are shifted to the closest reproducible color in\n"
"    the destination color space. This preserves more of the original\n"
"    colors in a photo than Perceptual. (See also [Black point\n"
"    compensation](Black_Point_Compensation.html).)\n"
"Perceptual\n"
"  ~ Tries to preserve the visual relationship between colors so it is\n"
"    perceived as natural to the human eye even though the color values\n"
"    themselves may change. This intent is suitable for photos with lots\n"
"    of out-of-gamut colors.\n"
"Saturation\n"
"  ~ Tries to produce vivid colors in a photo at the expense of color\n"
"    accuracy. This intent is suitable for business graphics like graphs\n"
"    or charts where bright saturated colors are more important than the\n"
"    exact relationship between colors.\n"
