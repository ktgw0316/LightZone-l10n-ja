"The **Zone System** was developed by Ansel Adams and Fred Archer in the "
"1940s as a method for achieving consistent results from exposing negative "
"film all the way to paper prints. The Zone System is a framework that "
"photographers can use to think about their photos and perform meaningful "
"operations on them, such as altering exposure, contrast, and most all other "
"visual aspects of a photo."

"With the [ZoneFinder](ZoneFinder.html) and "
"[ZoneMapper](Tool-ZoneMapper.html) tool, LightZone offers a unique "
"implementation of the Zone System that has been adapted from negative film "
"to digital media and interactive image processing allowed by modern "
"computers. If you are familiar with the Zone System, you probably have "
"noticed that there are differences between the traditional Zone System and "
"LightZone."

"The traditional Zone System was developed for negative film and has 11 zones "
"where each zone differs by one *exposure value* (one \"EV\" which is "
"equivalent to one f-stop). Middle (or 18%) gray falls onto zone 5."

"The traditional Zone System takes into account the nonlinear nature of both "
"film and photographic paper that compresses the tonal values of highlights "
"and shadows (the \"shoulder\" and \"toe\" of photographic media)."

"LightZone instead was developed for digital cameras and computers and has 16 "
"zones where each zone differs by *half* an EV. Middle gray falls onto the "
"fifth zone from the top."

"The reason for the differences are that digital cameras and computers use a "
"linear representation for values of light and that computer displays have a "
"dynamic range that is less than 8 EVs. Using half EV spacing for zones in "
"LightZone results in 16 zones and gives the best compromise between screen "
"space and precision."
