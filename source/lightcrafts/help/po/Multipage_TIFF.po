"Other applications that display multipage TIFF images show the first page by "
"default. Therefore, the first page is like a full-sized preview of your "

"page and you can resume editing where you left off."

"A disadvantage of two-page TIFF files is that they are, of course, twice as "
"big. Therefore, they are recommended only when integrating with either "
"[Aperture](Integration-Aperture.html) or "
