"To achieve the best print quality, make sure that you understand and "
"properly use the settings in the printer driver. Incorrect settings can and "
"most likely will result in lower print quality. Pay extra attention to the "
"choice of letting LightZone or the printer driver do the color conversion."

"It is important to note that, for most printers, there isn't one setting "
"that will always give the best results. You might encounter some color "
"photos that print very well on your printer using certain settings or a "
"certain color profile, and others that just won't print well. If that is the "
"case, try different settings altogether. If your photo does not print well "
"using a custom ICC profile for your printer, try using the standard or vivid "
"settings in your printer driver instead."

"For black-and-white printing, most inkjet printers manufactured before 2005 "
"have been inferior in terms of linearity, neutrality and metamerism "
"failure. (Metamerism refers to the situation where two color samples appear "
"to match under one condition but not under another.) However, the latest "
"generation from all the major inkjet printer manufacturers looks promising."
