"When either [converting](Converting.html) or [printing](Printing.html)  your "
"photos using application managed colors, you can enable *black point "
"compensation* when the [rendering intent](Rendering_Intent.html)  is "
"Relative Colorimetric."

"The RGB color space can represent all luminosities from 100% white to 100% "
"black. Output devices (such as printers and computer displays)  often have "
"limitations in how black the darkest black they can render is. Black point "
"compensation attempts to resolve the difference between the darkest black in "
"your photo and the darkest black that a particular device can render."

"![image](images/Black_Point_Compensation-en.png) If no black point "
"compensation is done, then detail will be lost in the darkest shadow areas "
"of your photo because the dark areas beyond the darkest black the device can "
"render are truncated."

"On the other hand, if black point compensation is done, the luminosity range "
"of your photo is compressed to fit into the luminosity range of the "
"device. Hence, the darkest black of your photo becomes the darkest black "
"that the device can render."

"However, because the luminosity range is compressed, information from your "
"photo is still lost: the loss is just evenly spread out over the entire "
"luminosity range (and thus less noticeable) rather than being truncated at "
"the black end."
