"Some digital cameras have an orientation sensor so that photos shot in "
"portrait mode are automatically rotated right-side-up when you look at "
"them. However, since some digital cameras do not have such a sensor, photos "
"shot in portrait mode appear sideways in the [Photo "
"Browser](Anatomy-Browser.html). This can be corrected by rotating them."
