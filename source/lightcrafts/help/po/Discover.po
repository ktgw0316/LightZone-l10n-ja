"LightZone is a breakthrough in photo editing software that makes it easier "
"to edit digital photos and quickly achieve professional quality results."

msgid ""
"LightZone is designed for photographers and differs in many fundamental ways "
"from pixel painting programs that force you to think in terms of pixels or "
"use complex mathematical concepts like histograms and curves.  LightZone "
"uses a model based on the physics of light and methods derived from the "
"experience of photographers through the decades -- in the field, behind the "
"camera, and in the darkroom."

"![image](images/Region.png)  Using regions to create masks, you can restrict "
"a tool's effect to just specific areas of your photo. Unlike other "
"applications, LightZone allows you to *draw* (rather than *paint*) "
"regions. Regions are therefore always editable. Additionally, every region "
"has a *feathering area* that smoothly blends the region into the surrounding "
"area preventing sharp edges. [More on regions...](Regions.html)"

"doesn't introduce errors (such as increasing noise, edge distortion, and hue "
"shifts) during enhancement operations such as sharpening, blurring, or "

"supported. Therefore, there is no need for an intermediate \"raw "

"![image](images/Tool_Stack_Illustration-small.png)  LightZone organizes the "
"tools used to edit your photo into a stack similarly to \"layers\" in other "
"applications. Unlike other applications' layers, *every* tool becomes a "
"layer in the tool stack. (For example, you create a sharpen tool *as a "
"layer* rather than sharpening an existing layer.) This means that every tool "
"is non-destructive and therefore can be modified or deleted at any "
