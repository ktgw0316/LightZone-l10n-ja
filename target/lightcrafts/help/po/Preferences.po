"Auto Save\n"
"  ~ Ordinarily when you are editing a photo, if you try to edit another\n"
"    photo, LightZone will present you with a Save alert asking you\n"
"    whether you want to [save your work](Saving.html) before viewing the\n"
"    preview image for the other photo. Selecting this option will save\n"
"    your work automatically.\n"
"Browser Cache\n"
"  ~ To operate quickly, LightZone caches thumbnail images of your photos\n"
"    in hidden folders on your computer. The hidden folders can either go\n"
"    in the same folders as your photos (\"local\") or all together in one\n"
"    location (\"global\").\n"
"Check for Update\n"
"  ~ If checked, LightZone will automatically check to see if a new\n"
"    software version is available when launched. If a new version is\n"
"    available, you will be notified by an alert. Note that your computer\n"
"    must have a connection to the internet when LightZone is launched in\n"
"    order to check. (If there is no internet connection, the check is\n"
"    skipped.)\n"
"Copyright Preferences\n"
"  ~ These preferences allow you to set default values for the name of\n"
"    the artist/photographer and the copyright notice when [editing the\n"
"    metadata](Metadata.html) of your photos.\n"
"Direct Save\n"
"  ~ When checked, using LightZone as the [external editor for another\n"
"    application](Workflow_Integration.html) will cause LightZone to save\n"
"    your photo directly back to the other application when you select\n"
"    File \\> Save.\n"
"Interactive Rendering\n"
"  ~ This controls when your photo is updated while you\n"
"    [create](Regions-Creating.html) or [adjust](Regions-Adjusting.html)\n"
"    a [region](Regions.html). - **All the time:** Your photo will be\n"
"    updated continuously. - **Between Region Changes:** Your photo will\n"
"    not be updated until you release the mouse. - **When Regions are\n"
"    Done:** Your photo will not be updated until you are done adjusting\n"
"    a region (by clicking outside the region, or by pressing either the\n"
"    **return** or **esc** (escape) key).\n"
"Memory Limit\n"
"  ~ This sets the upper limit on the amount of memory that LightZone\n"
"    will use. A high limit enables LightZone to operate faster and\n"
"    smoother; a low limit leaves more memory available for other\n"
"    applications.\n"
"Reset LightZone Settings\n"
"  ~ Clicking the Reset button will reset LightZone to have its original\n"
"    factory settings. This can sometimes resolve some problems you may\n"
"    experience. Note that after a reset is performed, LightZone must\n"
"    quit.\n"
"Scratch Folder\n"
"  ~ This is the folder that LightZone will use to store data temporarily\n"
"    while you edit your photos. If you have a fast hard disk, using a\n"
"    folder on it will enable LightZone to operate faster.\n"
"Show Tool Titles\n"
"  ~ When checked, the user interface shows titles for the buttons; when\n"
"    unchecked, only the buttons themselves are shown.\n"
"Save to Folder\n"
"  ~ This controls the folder to which your photos are saved whenever\n"
"    File \\> Save is selected the first time for a photo.\n"
