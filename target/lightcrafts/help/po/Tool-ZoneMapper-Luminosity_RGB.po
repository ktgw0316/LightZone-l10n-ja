"![image](images/Tool-ZoneMapper-Luminosity_RGB-en.png) Each pixel in a "
"digital photo is comprised of red, green, and blue (RGB) values. A pixel's "
"*luminosity* (\"brightness\") value is a weighted average of those three "
"values."

"However, on occasion, luminosity-based adjustments can result in problems "
"such as *color-clipping*. For example, if your photo has saturated "
"highlights such as a clear blue sky, then increasing brightness will clip "
"colors in portions of the sky because pixels that are already saturated blue "
"can't become more blue."
